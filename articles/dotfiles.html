            <p>Managing dotfiles is a pain, especially when working on multiple
hosts (your host at home, your host in the office, your cloud VMs,
etc), I was therefore looking for a solution that would
allow me to save my dotfiles and manage them easily.</p>
<p>If you don't know what this is about, dotfiles are
all those configuration files you keep in your $HOME usually in a hidden
file (starting with a dot, therefore <em>dotfile</em>).</p>
<p>There exist several smart solutions on how to save your dotfiles, here
are some solutions I almost adopted:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot">https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/dots">https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/dots</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jaagr/dots">https://github.com/jaagr/dots</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Check the page <a href="https://dotfiles.github.io/">Github does dotfiles</a> for
more tools on dotfiles.</p>
<p>Those solutions are awesome but didn't exactly match what I needed.
Here are some of the requirements I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want my dotfiles to be versioned (preferably with git).</li>
<li>I want to store each dotfile only once (no multiple repositories,
    no duplicate, ...).</li>
<li>I want to be able to easily compare my local version with
    the stored one.</li>
<li>I want my management tool to handle multiple profiles (for different
    hosts: home, desktop, VM, ...).</li>
<li>I want different versions of same dotfile to be generated
    depending on where I want it deployed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the tools out there are designed for people using either a single
host or the same set of dotfiles on all their hosts.
One exception is <a href="https://github.com/tomjnixon/Dotfiles">ConMan</a> which is a nice
tools that uses <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/m4.html">M4 macro processor</a> to
generate the dotfiles. I found the idea really interesting but was missing the
possibility to compare the local dotfiles with the ones stored.
Moreover I wanted to code something ;-)</p>
<p>I thus decided to implement my own tool to manage my dotfiles. I went for
Python3 and needed a templating engine to parse and generate different versions
of the same files based on macros. This led me to <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">jinja2</a>,
a well recognized templating engine for python.</p>
<p>The resulting tool is <strong><a href="https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop">dotdrop</a></strong> !
Dotdrop's goal is to help you manage your dotfiles by storing them once and deploying
them on different hosts the way you want them to be.</p>
<p>Dotdrop keeps all its configs in a config file (<code>config.yaml</code>) where all
the different dotfiles are listed as well as the profiles where they should
be deployed. It thus gives the ability to have different sets
of dotfiles on different hosts. For example you would install all your dotfiles
on your home laptop but would have only a subset for your vserver (a stripped down
version of vimrc for example along with some other basic dotfiles: tmux, etc).
Also it leverages the power of <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">jinja2</a> by allowing to
template your dotfiles such that the same stored dotfile could be generated differently
depending on where it is to be installed.</p>
<p>It has nice features like the ability to import your dotfiles automatically and
to compare the dotfiles you have currently on your host with the ones stored
on dotdrop; such that if you change your dotfiles from your desktop, you are
able to see what has changed and how you need to update it on dotdrop
to reflect what you want.</p>
<p>Let's take an example: you want to manage the following two files using dotdrop:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>$HOME/.xinitrc</em>: it is to be deployed on both your home and your office host but
  with two different versions of the file.</li>
<li><em>$HOME/.vimrc</em>: it only needs to be deployed on your home host.</li>
</ul>
<p>A template for jinja2 needs to be set up for <em>.xinitrc</em> such that different versions of
that file are installed using dotdrop (no worry it's straight forward and doesn't
need much to be efficient):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="c1"># load Xresources</span>
<span class="nv">userresources</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.Xresources
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> -f <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$userresources</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
      xrdb -merge <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$userresources</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="p">&amp;</span>
<span class="k">fi</span>

<span class="c1"># launch the wm</span>
<span class="o">{</span>%@@ <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">profile</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;home&quot;</span> @@%<span class="o">}</span>
<span class="nb">exec</span> awesome
<span class="o">{</span>%@@ <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="nv">profile</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;office&quot;</span> @@%<span class="o">}</span>
<span class="nb">exec</span> bspwm
<span class="o">{</span>%@@ endif @@%<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When the above dotfile is deployed it will result in two different file depending
if you are running it from the <em>home</em> profile or the <em>office</em> one
(see the <strong>if branch</strong> above). Jinja2 templating
engine will choose the right branch and drop the rest such that the resulting file
is a clean dotfile.</p>
<p>Moreover using the config file you are able to specify what needs to be installed
with which profile:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">config</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="nt">backup</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>
  <span class="nt">create</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>
  <span class="nt">dotpath</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">dotfiles</span>
<span class="nt">dotfiles</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="nt">f_xinitrc</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nt">dst</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">~/.xinitrc</span>
    <span class="nt">src</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">xinitrc</span>
  <span class="nt">f_vimrc</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nt">dst</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">~/.vimrc</span>
    <span class="nt">src</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">vimrc</span>
<span class="nt">profiles</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="nt">home</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">f_xinitrc</span>
  <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">f_vimrc</span>
  <span class="nt">office</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">f_xinitrc</span>
</code></pre></div>
