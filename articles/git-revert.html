            <p>As a reminder to myself and maybe to help others too, <strong>try to avoid
reverting a merge if you plan on merging it some later times !</strong></p>
<p>Let's consider an example in order to understand why this could be a problem.
First create a repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>mkdir repo<span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> repo<span class="p">;</span> git init
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;master-file-1&#39;</span> &gt; master-file-1
git add *
git commit -a -m <span class="s1">&#39;master-file-1&#39;</span>

<span class="c1"># master --o--H</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now a new branch <em>branch</em> is created and two files are added to it</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git checkout -b branch
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;branch-file-1&#39;</span> &gt; branch-file-1
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;branch-file-2&#39;</span> &gt; branch-file-2
git add *
git commit -a -m <span class="s1">&#39;branch-file-*&#39;</span>

<span class="c1"># master --o--H</span>
<span class="c1">#           \</span>
<span class="c1"># branch     o--H</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>At this time the <em>branch</em> branch is (supposingly) ready to be merged with master</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># now comes the merge (M)</span>
git checkout master
git merge branch

<span class="c1"># master --o------M--H</span>
<span class="c1">#           \    /</span>
<span class="c1"># branch     o--o</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>However for some reason the merge needs to be reverted (issue with master, unstable, not the right
time, etc)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># now comes the revert (W)</span>
git revert &lt;commit&gt;

<span class="c1"># master --o------M--W--H</span>
<span class="c1">#           \    /</span>
<span class="c1"># branch     o--o</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is not directly an error, but it could become an issue if you don't realize
what was exactly done here. A revert will actually create a new commit that is the opposite
of what was done by the merge, i.e. removing the two files that were committed in the
<em>branch</em> branch.
Therefore the master branch's history now contains a commit that says that the two files
<em>branch-file-1</em> and <em>branch-file-2</em>
have been removed. This commit is more recent that the one that actually added the files in
the first place. Thus if those file are not changed, they will never be added in a future
merge.</p>
<p>Let's see that with an example. One of the two files is updated in the <em>branch</em> branch</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># update branch (C)</span>
git checkout branch
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;some change&#39;</span> &gt; branch-file-2
git commit -a -m <span class="s1">&#39;update&#39;</span>

<span class="c1"># master --o------M--W--H</span>
<span class="c1">#           \    /</span>
<span class="c1"># branch     o--o-------C--H</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And the new version of the branch is merged</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># and re-merge (Y)</span>
git checkout master
git merge branch

<span class="c1"># master --o------M--W---Y--H</span>
<span class="c1">#           \    /      /</span>
<span class="c1"># branch     o--o------C--H</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now two things are happening, first a conflict arises between the two versions of the <em>branch-file-2</em>,
the one in master that was deleted and the one from branch <em>branch</em>  that was modified. That is expected and needs
to be fixed. The second issue, which is more problematic, is that the file <em>branch-file-1</em> <strong>does not
at all (re-)appear in the master branch</strong>. It makes sense since for the master branch it has been deleted
in a commit that is more recent than the one that actually created it but it might not be directly expected
without having understood exactly what the first revert did.</p>
<p>How to fix this then and actually have <strong>all changes</strong> from branch <em>branch</em> being merged into master ?
Well the revert (W) needs to be reverted first and then the whole branch <em>branch</em> re-merged in Master.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># revert the revert (X) and merge (N)</span>
git checkout master
git revert &lt;revert-commit&gt;
git merge branch

<span class="c1"># master --o------M--W--X---N--H</span>
<span class="c1">#           \    /         /</span>
<span class="c1"># branch     o--o---------C--H</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That's it, now all changes/files brought by branch <em>branch</em> are in master.</p>
